# Sprint+
A simple [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) fabric mod that provides more intuitive(at least for me) sprinting to gameplay
## Description
+ I made this mod due to the counter-intuitive sprinting action from vanilla.
+ You will stop sprinting once you fall below a certain movement speed, so when you get a bump, your sprinting will be canceled, and the vanilla way of the toggling sprint is counter-intuitive for me since you ultimately are just manipulating a boolean variable, and holding does not require you hold but just toggle into sprinting which bring us back to first problem.
+ Therefore this mod is born, long story short, once you start to sprint, you will keep sprinting unless you let your forward key go. Even after you get bumped and stop sprinting it will automatically restart sprinting for you.
+ Sprint+ (default: `LControl`)
> Note: it will show conflicting with the default vanilla sprint key, but it will not effect any functionality, so if you want you can unbind the vanilla sprint key but it is not required. And it does not effect by sprint toggle option.
